# Clock
A clock or a timepiece is a device used to measure and indicate time. The clock is one of the oldest human inventions, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units: the day, the lunar month and the year. Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia.
I have coded  create this clock using HTML,Css and Js for functionalities.
